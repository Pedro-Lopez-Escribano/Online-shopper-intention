# Online shoppers intention

* I have developed this project with the purpose of testing the h2o API and some libraries to visualize the performance of the ML algorithms, also to remember some things about R.

* You can find two reports, one focused for people who don't have much technical knowledge, and another one where I include all the code and the result, more suitable for people with a technical profile. The HTML is too big to see here, I provide the following links so you can access it.
