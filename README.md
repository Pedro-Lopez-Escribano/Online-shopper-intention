# Online shopper intention

* I have developed this project with the purpose of testing the h2o API and some libraries to visualize the performance of the ML algorithms, also to remember some things about R.

 * I recommend you to open the reports, you don't need any specific app. You can find two reports, one focused for people who don't have much technical knowledge, and another one where I include all the code and the result, more suitable for people with a technical profile.
